### History of Linux

In early 90s using Operating System was not affordable. Company had to pay huge amount of money to use OS like UNIX.

The Bell lab was telephonic company but in 1970s it started creating UNIX which is the first Operating System.

Bell Lab started distributing & selling it to different companies but it was too expensive.

In 1980, Richard Stallman aka God of Free Software started creating free software.

In 1985, Richard Stallman started non profitable organization Free Software Foundation.

In 1991, Linus Torvalds created his own Kernel (kernel is middleware which interacts between hardware and software) known as Linux & made it free for all.

Basically, Linux alone is not an OS, it is a kernel and it requires some software to run. After this Richard & Linus came together and made first Free OS which is GNU/Linux.
